## Pre-installation operations

### Change BIOS settings
Please see [BIOS](#BIOS)

### Hard Disk (Solid State) Settings
- Make sure the hard drive is in GUID format
- Confirm that the hard disk EFI partition is larger than 400M
- Confirm that there are no built-in solid-state and mechanical disks that are not supported by other black apples

### Download and install for Mac
- [Download](https://github.com/bilijp153/ASUS-VivoBook-FL8700JP-Hackintosh/releases) EFI
- Go to [Heiguo Xiaobing's Tribal Pavilion](https://blog.daliansky.net/) to download the black apple image (please see [System Compatibility](#System-Compatibility) for the downloaded version)
- Download balenaEtcher
- Use a USB disk of at least 16G to copy the downloaded Black Apple image
- Copy the downloaded EFI file to the EFI partition of the hard drive
- Use software (such as EasyUEFI) to create an EFI boot just copied to the EFI partition
- Partition using Hard Disk Utility
- Press Esc to enter the boot selection menu and select the newly created EFI boot
- Then you will enter the OpenCore menu, select the Install item
- Wait for the progress bar to fill up and enter the installer
- Enter Disk Utility, select the drive letter you just partitioned, format it as APFS, and then exit back to the main interface
- Choose to install Mac, follow the prompts to install
- The Mac settings interface appears after multiple restarts
- Enjoy your Mac after setup

Note: BootX64.efi needs to be selected when setting EFI boot, if BootX64.efi does not work, select OpenCore.efi in the OC folder


## Post-installation operations

### Change SMBIOS (three codes)
- Use the OCAT or OpenCore Configurator (hereafter referred to as the tool) model menu to generate your unique `SMBIOS (three code)` information.
`SMBIOS (three-code)` must be unique, you cannot use the one that exists in this `repository (EFI)`.
- Run the tool and select Generate SMBIOS.
- Use the table below to select the appropriate model for your hardware.

| Brand | Model |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Apple | Apple MacBook Pro 16,2 |
| Apple | Apple MacBook Air 9,1 |

- Go to `Apple Serial Number Check Website` via the tool's Verify Serial Number button and enter the verification code (the serial number is automatically entered).
- An "Invalid Serial Number" or "Purchase Date Not Verified" message is required to work. If you get other prompts, you must generate a new SMBIOS (code three) and check again.

### Use BootCamp
- Download [brigadier](https://github.com/corpnewt/brigadier) of [corpnewt](https://github.com/corpnewt)
- Follow the prompts to install py
- The program will automatically download the `Bootcamp program on Windows` when finished
- Follow the prompts to open the downloaded `dmg` and copy the files inside to the Windows system disk
- Enter the model settings of EFI `Use OCAT or OpenCore Configurator` to open, modify the model item so that `Windows` thinks you are a Mac model
- Reboot into Windows (how to enter Windows to see [BIOS](#BIOS))
- Install the Bootcamp program
- Follow the installer prompt to reboot, then go back to `Mac`
- Enter the model settings of EFI `Use OCAT or OpenCore Configurator` to open, modify the model item so that `Windows` no longer thinks you are a Mac model
- Finish! Enjoy the boot just like real Mac



## Bugs
1.~~There is a probability of `switching from Windows to Mac OS` when there is no sound on Mac OS (if the `Realtek` driver under `Windows` is the HDA driver that comes with `Windows`, there is no such bug)~~ (Fixed )

2. ~~Sleep~~ (Fixed)

3.~~battery~~ (repaired)

4.~~Nuclear display intermittent boot black screen problem~~ (fixed)

5. ELAN1200 indirect disconnection (belonging to ELAN1200 common problem)
